;;; Commentary:

;; Launch files and directories using the associated applications provided by
;; your operating system.

;; If you're like me, you love using Emacs for all of your text
;; management needs.  But sometimes, there are documents that you'd like
;; to open with other programs.

;; For instance, you might want to launch your file manager to look at
;; pretty thumbnails in the current directory.  Or you're editing HTML and
;; want to launch your document in the system's web browser.

;; Launch makes it easy to do this by using your OS's built-in
;; file-associations to launch the appropriate program for a particular
;; file.


;;; Installation:

;; Launch is available from MELPA <http://melpa.milkbox.net/>.
;; Just run \\[package-install] and install `launch'.

;; Then, in your ~/.emacs configuration, add:
;;     (global-launch-mode +1)

;; If you only want to enable it for certain modes, add:
;;     (add-hook 'html-mode 'turn-on-launch-mode)

;;; Usage:

;; With a buffer open to a file, launch it with C-c ! !. Or, to open
;; the file manager for the current directory, use C-c ! d. Try it with
;; `ido-everywhere' turned on.

;; Inside special buffers like `dired' or `vc-dir', launch marked files using
;; C-c ! !. To just launch the default directory itself, use C-c ! d.

;;; Bugs:

;; Please report bugs to http://github.com/sfllaw/emacs-launch/issues

;; * This library is untested on Windows or Mac OS X. Pull requests welcome.
